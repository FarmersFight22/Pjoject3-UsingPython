# Pjoject3-UsingPython

In this repository you'll find code for Group 00 for Project #3: Using Python.  

As per the instructions, this program will be executable via the command line of a linux system.  The project will take HTTP server logs from the webserver and provide some data to the user (for this project a hypothetical marketing department) regarding the log files.

The given directions for the project are:

Marketing wants to know two things: 
How many total requests have been made in the last year?
How many total requests were made in the time period represented by the log?


You will need to output this data to the screen. The format you choose to do this is up to you, but your decisions and your implementation should be logical and consistent.


Your program should be created and developed using GitHub (I will be examining the commit logs to see your work). When the project is due, submit your repository URL so I can clone the repo and test your program.
